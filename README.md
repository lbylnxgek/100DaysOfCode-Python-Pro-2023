# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (2023) on Udemy

My solutions & other work for the projects included in the [Python Pro Bootcamp 2023 by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## Day 1 - Beginner - Working with variables in Python to manage data

* [Project: Cover Band name generator](/Day-001/.)

## Day 2 - Beginner - Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings

* [Project: Tip Calculator](/Day-002/.)

## Day 003 - Beginner - Control flow and logical operators

* [Project: Treasure Island](/Day-003/.)

## Day 004 - Beginner - Randomization and Python lists

* [Coding challenge work and project: Rock, Paper, Scissors!](/Day-004/.)

## Day 005 - Beginner - Python loops

* [Project: Random password generator](/Day-005/.)

## Day 006 - Beginner - Python functions & Karel (really Reeborg) the robot

* [Coding challenge work and project: Reeborg's maze](/Day-006/.)
* Note: My solution (reeborgs-world-maze-redux.py) works for all three problem
    samples and was 25/25 on random worlds.  That said I do not know if it would
    work for larger/more complex worlds as it uses the build_wall() function.
    The instructor's solution was definitely simpler and has been included as well.

## Day 007 - Beginner - Hangman

* [Project: Hangman](/Day-007/.)
* Note: There are a couple of features I want to add to this version:
  * Use a bigger dictionary
  * Display a list of letters already guessed (right, wrong or both?)
  * Don't subtract a life if they guess a letter already guessed.  I thought that was already in the instructor's TODO but it doesn't appear to be.

## Day 008 - Beginner - Function parameters & Caesar cipher

* [Project: Caesar cipher](/Day-008/)
* Note: My solution re-prompts the user for valid responsese.  In particular I did not use the modulus (%) function to fix invalid shift input.
