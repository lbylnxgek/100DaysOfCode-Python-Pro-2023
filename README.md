# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (2023) on Udemy

My solutions & other work for the projects included in the [Python Pro Bootcamp 2023 by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

### Day 1 - Beginner - Working with variables in Python to manage data
* [Solution: Cover Band name generator](/Day-001/.)

### Day 2 - Beginner - Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings
* [Solution: Tip Calculator](/Day-002/.)

### Day 003 - Beginner - Control flow and logical operators
* [Solution: Treasure Island](/Day-003/.)

### Day 004 - Beginner - Randomization and Python lists
* [Coding challenge work and solution: Rock, Paper, Scissors!](/Day-004/.)

### Day 005 - Beginner - Python loops
* [Solution: Random password generator](/Day-005/.)

### Day 006 - Beginner - Python functions & Karel (really Reeborg) the robot
* [Coding challenge work and solution: Reeborg's maze](/Day-006/.)
* **Note: My solution (reeborgs-world-maze-redux.py) works for all three problem
    samples and was 25/25 on random worlds.  That said I do not know if it would
    work for larger/more complex worlds as it uses the build_wall() function.
    The instructor's solution was definitely simpler and has been included as well.**

### Day 007 - Beginner - Hangman
* [Solution: Hangman](/Day-007/project/.)
* Note: There are a couple of features I want to add to this version:
  * Use a bigger dictionary
  * Display a list of letters already guessed (right, wrong or both?)
  * Don't subtract a life if they guess a letter already guessed.  I thought that was already in the instructor's TODO but it doesn't appear to be.
